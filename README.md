# University Enrollment & Economic Impact

This project is a data science analysis exploring the relationship between university enrollment rates and various economic indicators across countries with different levels of development. The analysis focuses on Germany (developed), Egypt (developing), and Ethiopia (underdeveloped), investigating how education influences income, unemployment, and public expenditure effectiveness.

## Overview

The report is divided into three primary sections:
1. **Enrollment & Income** – How changes in enrollment affect GDP per capita.
2. **Enrollment & Unemployment** – Investigating general and gender-specific relationships.
3. **Enrollment & Expenditure** – Assessing the role of government spending in influencing enrollment levels.

## Key Findings

- Developed countries like Germany may show inverse relationships between enrollment and income due to better direct-to-workforce opportunities.
- In underdeveloped regions like Ethiopia, improved economic conditions correlate positively with education uptake.
- Gender disparities remain significant, especially in Egypt, where female unemployment rates remain disproportionately high despite educational improvements.
- Government spending effectiveness varies: Egypt shows positive outcomes, while Germany and Ethiopia reveal inefficiencies or barriers.
